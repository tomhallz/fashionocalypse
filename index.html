            <p>Welcome to the fashionocalypse, </p>
            <p>All fashion in the world has been drained, only the rich and powerful have the fleeckest clothes and fashion. Anarchy and violence rage throughout cities across the world for the best clothes. You must fight to find the best clothes from the fleeckest enemies. </p>
            <p>Kim is the most fashionable person in the world. You must kill her and become the queen of earth and space, becoming the fashion icon. You must restore the world to peace from the evil queen Kim Kardashian. You must do this for the future of the world. Good Luck! </p>
